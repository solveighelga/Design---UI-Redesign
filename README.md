# Redesign of Eyja v√≠nstofa
### When I started this project I thought they only had a instagram page and facebook and wanted to make a website for them. 
### Then I stumbled on to their website and because I had already started I decided to just continue with the project and then it really was a redesig :D
## Home Page
### this is my first time using Figma. I put everything that was going on the homepage on one page // See comments on Figma.
### From the start you get a sence of the place from the picture. Their main goal is for people to book a table so I wanted that to be visable at all times. The logo is at the beginning but then it fades away as you scroll and the navbar gets smaller. The secong thing you see on the page is a recommendation. the third is their opening hours and at the bottom is their location + building to make a good connection and get a feeling for the place.
## Menu Page
### Page two is next to the Home page and I decided to make the Menu because it was next to Home in the Navbar. I picked a background of their menu because pictures say more then just the words and even though you can't see exactly what is on the menu you get kind of the feeling of the place. Here is the first navbar where the logo acts as a "home" button, book a table is always available and at the buttom is the info the custumer would like to know.
